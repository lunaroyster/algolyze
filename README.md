## What is algolyze?

Algolyze is a way to find and learn about algorithms. It's a list of algorithms along with a website that categorizes and makes it easy to find what you're interested in learning.

The idea is that you should be able to search not only for algorithms, but also for what you want to do with them.

## Algolyze in action   

### Search
Algolyze performs a fuzzy search through all the algorithms on it, and helps you find what you're looking for.

### Tags
You can filter through tags at https://algolyze.me/#!/tags

Algorithms are tagged with the categories they fall under. The page above displays tags along with the number of algorithms carrying that tag. As you click on a tag, you can view the algorithms under it, alongside dominant subtags (which you can also add to your query to narrow down your search further)

### Algorithm pages
Here's an example of an algorithm page: [Insertion sort](https://algolyze.me/#!/a/Insertion-Sort)

Algorithm pages aim to describe an algorithm. They **explain its functioning** in detail, providing **common use scenarios**, **pseudocode**, links to **learning resources**, and access to **popular libraries** and **implementations**.
